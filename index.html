                    <h2>Heuristic analysis</h2>
                    <p>To determine some of the current areas in which the Wearable app could improve upon the mobile version, we performed a heuristic analysis of the MyPhonak App against Nielsen's 10 heuristics for user interface design. The app was tested while using wearing hearing aids for an accurate experience. The areas in which the application could be improved were logged.</p>
                    <h2>Forum Digging</h2>
                    <p>A large number of reviews (both positive and negative) were examined to determine the major pain points that a wearable  application could improve upon.</p>
                    <h2>Ergonomic Considerations</h2>
                    <p>As the primary users of the Phonak hearing aids are older adults, it was important to conduct some analysis into making the application physically accessible, especially due to the screen size of wearable devices.</p>
                    <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                    <p>Hearing from primary users is paramount to creating a solid user experience. For this reason, we conducted user interviews with older adults that use hearing aids as well as audiologists who are responsible for selling and maintaining hearing aids and other peripheral tools/applications.</p>
                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>The background research was distilled into the two most relevant personas for the use case. This would help keep discussions and solutions user-focused.</p>

                    <h1>Planning</h1>
                    <p>Translating the research findings into a usable prototype began with sketching out the rough appearance and location of elements as well as mapping out the general flow of the app.</p>
                    <div class="img-container">

                        <p>These sketches were then translated into higher fidelity mockups in Sketch.</p>

                    <h1>Validation</h1>
                    <p>The mockups were translated into a prototype app that was downloaded onto an Apple watch. We conducted usability testing  sessions with 4 hearing aid users, 3 of which were active smartwatch users. From these interviews, we were able to identify what the current smartwatch application did well and elements that could improved upon.</p>
                    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
                    <p>In its completed state, the application will require background bluetooth pairing capabilities to provide a worthwile user experience. At the time that this prototype was created, these capabilities were in development for the near future. The project displayed the potential that hearing instruments controlled in tandem with a smartwatch. The takeaways from this design sprint were thus documented for future use.</p>

                        <p>As a project for an Engineering Design course, I worked in a team of 6 as a designer to
                            create an accessible instrument. We tackled the following problem
                            statement:</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Design a synthesizer interface that will be accessible and engaging for
                            users who are or who have recently become completely blind allowing them to perform
                            expressive and interesting electronic music."</p>
                        <p>Our team tackled this project using iterative design methods, gradually developing our
                            instrument by applying the learnings gained after each iteration. Between each iteration was
                            a round of user testing and
                            background literature review to gain these insights. We had the incredibly fortunate
                            opportunity of
                            conducting user testing with blind users to truly make a design built for its users. You can
                            view the iterations below.</p>

                                <h1>First Iteration</h1>
                                <p>Our first iteration tested the idea of a modular interface, allowing the user to
                                    customize the position of controls to
                                    suit their needs. However, testing with blind users demonstrated that this actually
                                    made it difficult to create an
                                    initial mental map of the interface. There was no single source of truth the user
                                    could reference for the layout, such
                                    as a manual or guidebook.</p>

                                <p>Our second iteration focused on a single, more traditionally structured synthesizer
                                    interface, with the underlying distinction being that each control on the interface
                                    was unique. A large variety of types of controls was utilized, including dials,
                                    buttons, sliders, and joysticks. Additionally, controls were made with different
                                    materials, resulting in a different overall texture. To add to these differences,
                                    symbols were grafted on the tops of controls. The functionality of each control was
                                    prioritized to make distinct changes to the sound, providing the user with more
                                    feedback.</p>

                                    <h1>Final Iteration</h1>
                                    <p>Our final solution consisted of a synthesizer interface in which every control
                                        was physically unique in multiple
                                        dimensions. Dials had both different shapes and texture, and buttons had
                                        different numbers of bumps on them for
                                        differentiation. Braille labels were placed under each control to identify their
                                        function to the user. Controls that
                                        were commonly utilized together were placed next to one another, but enough
                                        space was given between controls to minimize
                                        unintentional inputs. The interface was compact in design, putting all controls
                                        within the 5th percentile for the
                                        maximum reach envelope of the seated female population, allowing them to all be
                                        operated without needing to reach
                                        forward. To validate that our solution solved the problem, our team performed
                                        user testing on blind users as well as
                                        blindfolded participants who had not yet seen the interface.</p>

                                    </div>
                                    <p>The design would be
                                        “successful” if users were able to
                                        identify all controls without sight, as well as determine the state of each
                                        control (e,g, the angle of a dial) without
                                        sight. Our current solution did a great job at having distinct inputs, but
                                        certain controls such as the dotted buttons
                                        were not easily distinguished. However, as a medium-fidelity prototype, the
                                        solution moved in the right direction from
                                        the second prototype, and thus qualified as a success.</p>

                    <p>Video game design has always been a passion of mine. For the past three years, I've been building games together with some of my talented friends. It's been a great exercise in understanding what makes a game fun and playable. Our latest project is a game called "Charge Champs", a multiplayer fighting game inspired by some of the games we love. I've been working on character art and the player UI. Check it out in action below</p>
